As mentioned earlier, our gridworld problem can be described as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**. Formally, a MDP is a 5-tuple $\\big \\langle \\mathcal{S,A,P,R,\\gamma}  \\big \\rangle$, where\n",

    "* $\\mathcal{R}$ - is the **reward function**. It determines how much reward is given for a specific (action, state transition) pair. Again, this can be stochastic or deterministic.\n",
    "* $\\mathcal{\\gamma}$ - is a discount factor $0 \\leq \\gamma \\leq 1$ that helps us to model the importance of short term vs. long term reward. Most commonly $\\gamma = 0.9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, **time** is modeled as discrete timesteps $t = 1,2,3,\\ldots$. If there exists a timestep $T < \\infty$ in which the environment reaches a **terminal state**  $S_T$, then the system is called **episodic MDP**. This stands in contrast to the **continuous** case where no such naturally occuring state exists. A similar distinction can be made for the state and action space. When you read something like *\"Continuous control for Deep Reinforcement Learning\"*, the authors typically refer to a continuous state or action space and not the time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now before we start implementing our first solution, let us quickly recap two more concepts that are central to all algorithms we discuss in this lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Policy\n",
    "The first one is the so called **policy** $\\pi$. It is basically a mapping from states to actions and **fully describes the behavior of an agent**. In the most simple, deterministic case this can be written as $\\pi_t(s) = a$. Think of a list of rules that literally is holding a state -> action pair for every state. More common in reinforcement learning is the usage of a **stochastic policy** which defines **the probability of choosing a distinct action $a$ given a state $s$**. Think of the random agent you just implemented. In every state the agent has chosen an action according to a **discrete uniform distribution** whereby every action is equally likely to be picked. Formally such policies are defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi_t(a \\mid s) = \\mathbb{P}\\big[A_t = a \\mid S_t = s\\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the discrete case, this can again be implemented as a simple list but now, holding the probabilites for every action in every state. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Value Functions\n",
    "The second concept is the so called **value function** $V$. The idea is simple, $V(s)$ tells us *how good* it is to be in a given state $s$. More precisely, it tells us **how much future reward we can expect** when starting from that specific state. The amount of future reward obviously depends on the policy which the agent is following, so formally we write $V_{\\pi}(s)$. In summary,\n",
    "\n",
    "> $V_{\\pi}(s)$ tells us how much reward we can expect when starting in state $s$ and following policy $\\pi$ thereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $V$ assigns values only to states, it is called the **state-value function**. Later we will also use the so called **action-value function** $Q(s,a)$ which estimates the future reward for every state-action pair separately. In other words,\n",
    "\n",
    "> $Q_{\\pi}(s,a)$ tells us how much reward we can expect when starting in state $s$, taking action $a$ and following policy $\\pi$ thereafter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gridworld Policy and Value Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, let us make this more concrete for our little gridworld.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create a state-value function `V` in the form of an $n \\times n$ dimensional numpy array and **initialize it with zeros**. We will use this kind of table to store and update all state values. The states itself are now implicitly described by the array indices. So the \"first\" state would be something like `row, col = 0, 0` and the value for that state can be retrieved by *calling* the value function `V[row,col]`, i.e. make an array lookup at this index. Now create and plot this thing with the code below."

Next, let us make use of this new *feature* in order to improve our policy and make it more sane.

Since this map is a 2-dimensional array, you can query specific states of the map in the same way as we represent our states in the value function, i.e. with indices. For instance you can use this map to check if a specific state contains an \"x\" or \"E\" character etc. However, note that our value function is of shape $4 \\times 4$ whereas the world map also contains the walls and is of shape $6 \\times 6$. If you now loop over all value function indices (states) make sure your add (1,1) to it in order to translate to the corresponding world position. \n",

To do so we can take a specific world position, add the value of an action to this tuple and check if the world map contains a wall character at the new position. The function `game.allowed_actions` does exactly this. It takes a *world position* in the form of a *tuple* and will return a reduced action set for that state.\n",

First, we will use **policy evaluation** to estimate the value of a given policy. Second we will use **policy improvement** to update our policy towards a better policy. Evaluating and improving a policy over and over will finally converge to a so called **optimal policy** $\\pi_*$ which is defined as a policy that is better or equal to all other policies. In consequence, all optimal policies will produce (or share) the same **optimal state-value function** $v_*(s) = \\displaystyle \\max_\\pi v_{\\pi}(s)$. In reverse, if we can find an optimal value function we can derive an optimal policy by simply acting greedy with respect to the value function, i.e. by picking the states and actions with the highest values.\n",
