    "\n",
    "In the last notebook you have implemented **Policy Iteration** with **Dynamic Programming** as your first RL algorithm. This was an optimal solution but you will rarely see DP applied to real world problems. Even though those methods are guaranteed to converge with probability 1 to an optimal policy, they suffer from two major drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Curse of dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is the so called **curse of dimensionality**, meaning that the computational requirements often grow exponentially with the number of state variables. Think of our policy array that we just created. It should be clear that this approach does not scale to a very high number of states/actions, which is the case in almost every real world problem. In such situations, even one update swipe through the entire state and action space can be computationally infeasible. Later we will see how to tackles this problem with **function approximation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning vs. Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The second problem is that we have *cheated* in the last part. More precicely, we have created a **world model** from the knowledge that we had about the grid world. While this was pretty easy in our case, it is very unlikely that you have that much knowledge about a real world environment. Or, that the underlying environment dynamics are given by a very complicated probability distribution that we don't know (or just can't model). In consequence, we can not simply calculate the expectation values for $V(s)$ or $Q(s,a)$. This is not possible since the expectation sum requires the knowledge of the state transition probabilities $\\mathcal{P}$ and the reward function $\\mathcal{R}$. If we don't have such a model, the next best thing we can do is to simply **learn from trial an error**, e.g. by interacting with the environment and see what happens. If this limitation sounds reasonable to you, welcome to **reinforcement learning**!   \n",

    "### Value based, model free RL\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the following, we will solve the **full reinforcement learning problem** by **learning** an **estimate of the value function** from **experience**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now instead of *simulating* the outcome of actions through a world model, the agent has to actually **interact** with the environment in order to produce new experience, i.e. gather training data. Although we are **learning** now from this data instead of *planning* ahead, we will stay with the idea of a value function. All RL algorithms that use the concept of a value function are called **value based**. Furthermore, since we assume, and have, no model of the environment, we are in the realm of **model free** reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that there is also a class of so called **model based** algorithms in the RL literature. However, these algorithms **do not have or assume a perfect world model** either but instead, try to learn the underlying dynamics and transition probabilities. Sometimes, in addtion to a value function and/or policy. The general idea is then to use this **imperfect model** again to *plan ahead* and *simulate* potential outcomes of actions even though the model is not entirely correct.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that within the Policy Iteration framework, we have calculated the **expected return**. We did so by decomposing the return into the immediate reward plus the discounted value of the expected next state or state-action pair. For the action-value function $Q(s,a)$ this has the form (*Bellman Expectation Equation*):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "Q_{\\pi}(s,a) &=& \\mathbb{E}\\Big[R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_{\\pi}(S_{t+1},A_{t+1}) \\mid S_t=s, A_t=a\\Big] \n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the calculation of the **expectation** $\\mathbb{E}$, requires us to sum over all possible outcomes and hence, requires knowledge about the state transition probabilities $\\mathcal{P}$ and the reward function $\\mathcal{R}$, we can't do this anymore. Instead, we have to learn from experience produced within the agent-environment loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./RL_pics/AgentEnvLoop.png\" alt=\"Agent-Environment-Loop\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "By interacting with the environment, an agent will produce *training data* in the form of state transition tuples $(S_t,A_t,R_{t+1},S_{t+1})$. Now instead of calculating the full expectation, we can use those tuples to calculate an **estimate of the true value function** by using them similarly to the Bellman Expectation Equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "Q_{\\pi}(s,a) &=& r_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_{\\pi}(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the concrete $(s,a,r,s')$ tuples as distinct *samples*, drawn from the underlying probability distributions $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$. If we can update $Q$ many times and with a *sufficient number* of distinct samples, our estimate will get closer to the true value function. This is the idea behind the so called **SARSA** algorithm (short for s,a,r,s',a'). However, SARSA does not apply the Bellman Expectation update directly but instead, uses a *softer* update rule. Because all Q-values are only estimates, it is better to not apply the full update $r_{t+1} + \\gamma Q(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})$ but rather use it as a **target** towards which we will update the old estimate. The complete idea is thereby to **take the old estimate** $Q(s,a)$ and **update it** only **a little bit towards the difference between old and new estimate**. Formally the update rules is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "Q(s_t, a_t) \\leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \\alpha \\left[ \\underbrace{r_{t+1} + \\gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})}_{target} - \\underbrace{Q(s_t, a_t)}_{current} \\right] \n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a small learning rate $0 < \\alpha \\leq 1$ and the full expression in square brackets is called the **TD-Error** (TD for Temporal-Difference). Such updates are called **on-policy** because the **same policy** was used to produce the sample and to choose the Q-value which to backup, i.e. to choose $a_{t+1}$ in $s_{t+1}$. Using this update rule, an agent can evaluate a given policy if it visits ~~every~~ enough state-action pairs multiple times. We can then improve the policy like in Policy Iteration and will finally arrive at an optimal policy after enough iterations."

    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "Q(s_t, a_t) \\leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \\alpha \\left[ \\underbrace{r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a)}_{target} - \\underbrace{Q(s_t, a_t)}_{current} \\right] \n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an **off-policy** update now because $r_{t+1}$ and $s_{t+1}$ are produced by the policy that we are following right now (**behavior policy**), but in the target, we always back up a Q-value according to a second, so called **target policy**, in this case a greedy **max** policy. Using such updates, we could for instance follow a random behavior policy to explore the environment (try out all states and actions) while improve at the same time with the greedy max policy. This is good because when learning from samples, it is crucial to visit *every* (ideally it should be every) state-action pair at least once, but as many times as possible in order to get a decent estimate of the value function. Evaluating such an exploration policy and improving on it at the same time (in one step), makes the update much more efficient compared to the SARSA algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we still need to **improve the behavior policy** over time in order to find an optimal policy. Because we are learning from samples, we first want to make sure that the agent has visited *enough* distinct state-action pairs before improving greedily. Otherwise we may ignore some potentially very good states and actions, only because the agent just has't seen them and therefore, we can't take them into account when improving the policy. On the other hand, we don't want to explore forever. This tradeoff between exploration and exploitation is know as the **exploration-exploitation** dilemma. The most common approach for balancing between these two is the **$\\epsilon$-greedy policy**."

This is what the $\\epsilon$-greedy policy does. With probability $\\epsilon$ select a random action, with probability $1 - \\epsilon$ select the best action so far. We can now control the transition by starting with $\\epsilon = 1$ and slowly decay it over $n$ time steps until we arrive at an almost fully greedy policy.

There is no need to store the policy in a separate array anymore because we can choose the best actions based on the Q-values array directly. Note that the function should take explicit values for epsilon as its third argument. The decay of epsilon will be handeled separately in the loop. Make sure that if there are multiple equally good actions, the greedy part should select randomly between them!\n",

    "### Build up from a basic agent-environment loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, now we can start implementing the Q-learning agent. For a clean approach, we suggest that you build up from a basic agent-environment and add the missing parts one by one. You dont have to read everything at once, just **work through the steps one by one** and come back after you have finished a task. You may want to proceed like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reimplement or copy & paste a **basic agent-environment loop**. This loop should contain a random agent that can play **multiple episodes** of the game and reports the total reward **per episode**.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize a fresh **Q-value function** and use it with the **e-greedy action selection** in the loop. Start by using a fixed `epsilon = 1`. Note that you will need the agents current state which you can get from `get_current_state`. The agent is still fully random at this point.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement a **decay schedule** for epsilon. The decay should be controllable with a `final_epsilon` value and a `final_exploration_step` value. After this final step (or if epsilon becomes too small), epsilon should be fixed to this final value. An easy way to verify your implementation is to keep track of epsilon with a list and plot it afterwards. Even though we deacy epsilon now, the agent is still fully random since we don't improve the policy yet.\n",
    "```\n",
    "# While in the loop do something like: epsilon_schedule.append(epsilon)\n",
    "# After the training plot the schedule: plt.plot(epsilon_schedule), plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If everything is working so far, integrate the **Q-learning update** into the loop. The full Q-learning algorithm is given in a cell below. If you are unsure, use it to check when to do what inside the loop. Congratulations, after this point you have implemented your first (Q-learning) agent that is actually able to **learn** something! Next, you definetly want to gain some insight of what is really going on. Either you want to debug your code or you want to verify the results in a more scientific way. In any case, back and forth between task 4 and 5 as you need to.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verify what the agent is doing. You have several options ranging from visual feedback to more scientific approaches which you would use in a paper or thesis. Include at least some of them into your loop.\n",
    "    - **Visual feedback**: e.g. use `ui.render` and `time.sleep`.<br><br>\n",
    "    - **Live plot of Q and Pi**: e.g. use `plot_things` , `plt.pause` and `display.clear_output(wait=True)`.<br><br>\n",
    "    - **Data visualisation**: e.g. keep track of `episode_rewards`, `epsilon_schedule` etc. and plot them afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that the *live* plotting option can be very *slow*. If you run the agent for many episodes this will take some time. For that reason you may prefer to plot the value function and policy only every `n` steps or just after the training. If you still want to plot the Q-learning agent *live* and in action (which is cool to watch) you may prefer to replace the `%matplotlib inline` backend with a more performant backend like `osx, qt, gtk,` etc. For a list of backends execute `%matplotlib -l` on top of a cell. **NOTE: If you change the plotting backend, better restart the notebook.** Do not switch backends from cell to cell. This kind of works but may result in significant slow downs."
