    "In the last notebook you have implemented the model-free **Q-Learning** algorithm and solved the *full reinforcement learning problem* by **learning from samples**. In this context, *full* refered to the fact that we dont have acess to the world model and *model-free* to the fact that we have not tried to learn that model. Furthermore, Q-Learning performed **online** updates to the policy, meaning that we have adjusted the policy *online* after every time step. Finally Q-Learning is an **off-policy** algorithm because we followed an e-greedy behavior policy while we have performed updates according to a greedy target policy. Now we will tackle the **curse of dimensionality** by **approximating the value function** instead of saving it explicitly in a table.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we proceed to the solution, let us quickly revise the actual problem that we are trying to solve. Consider the task of learning to play a video game given only the raw game screen as input. This is similar to how humans would play the game. Since the game screen is typically represented as raw pixels, this leaves us with a really high dimensional input or state space because every change of pixels represents a new and distinct state of the game, even if the change seems completely insignificant to you! Remember, the agent has no real knowledge of the game (or world model). Clearly it is infeasible to store every possible state of pixle combinations in a table. See [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) chapter 16.5 for a comprehensive discussion.   \n",

    "> The problem that is solved by Deep Reinforcement Learning (in the case of DQN) is how to learn a mapping from a high dimensional input space to action values. This mapping represents the value function and can be used in a policy, e.g. to choose the best action with the highest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonlinear Function Approximation with Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, a lookup table can mathematically be seen as a very simple form of a function, i.e. a direct mapping of values (hence the name value function). However, for the reasons explained above, this approach does not scale to high dimensional input spaces. A typical solution to this problem is to replace the *perfect* but intractable lookup table with a more complicated function that *only* **approximates the true value function** but is computationally tractable. In the case of DQN we choose a deep neural network as our function approximator. Formally, this new function is denoted as $\\hat{Q}$ and we write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "\\hat{Q}(s,a,\\theta) \\approx Q_{\\pi}(s,a)\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ are the parameters of the neural network. In other words, the value function now depends on those parameters and the task of finding and optimal value function turns into the task of finding an optimal set of parameters for the network. Fortunately, we know how to train and optimize a neural network with SGD and backpropagation given an appropriate loss function. **Inside the RL-framework we can use the TD-error as the loss function**. Formally we optimize:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "L_i(\\theta_{i}) = \\Big( \\underbrace{r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a; \\theta_i) - Q(s_t, a_t;\\theta_i)}_{TD-error} \\Big)^2\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that in order to obtain any action-values, we now need to perform a forward pass through the network. In practice, this means two forward passes before we can calculate the loss, one pass for the value of $Q(s_t, a_t;\\theta_i)$ and another one to calculate the value of $\\max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a; \\theta_i)$. More details on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instabilities and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, so good. By using the TD-error as loss function we can train the network in a supervised learning like setup. Sadly it is not that easy. Remember that in supervised learning we assumed the data to be *independent and identically distributed* (iid-data) in order for SGD to work properly. This assuption does not hold in reinforcement learning where subsequent data is highly correlated and in contrast, depends strongly on the agents last choice of actions. This inherent sequential property, in combination with an off-policy algorithm and a non-linear function appoximator such as a neural network, results in the problem that the learnable network parameters are at risk to oscillate or even diverge catastrophically during training. In theory, there is no convergence guarantee whatsoever. In practice, Mnih et al. found two major ways in which the training process can be stabilized:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experience Replay** - This idea introduces a so called **replay buffer** $\\mathcal{D}$ which stores the last $N$ state transitions as experience tuples $(S,A,R,S')$. In other words, the agent saves its recent history to a buffer. This way, experience can be reused and the correlation between samples can be broken by **drawing random minibatches** of experience $U(\\mathcal{D})$ from it during the training.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed Q-Targets** - The second idea is to keep **a separate set of parameters** $\\theta^{−}$ for calculating the **TD target**. This set is basically a copy of $\\theta$ that is held fixed for some time $t$ and periodically gets swapped with the current parameter values in order to allow progress. Mnih et al. have shown that updating $\\theta$ towards such fixed Q-targets is another effective way to stabilize the training process. In practice, this means that we have basically two separate networks which we will distinguish by their different set of parameters $\\theta^{-}$ and $\\theta$. We will refer to them respectively as **Target-** and **Q-Network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the **Q-learning update** of DQN at iteration $i$ uses the following loss function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "L_i(\\theta_{i}) = \\mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \\sim U(\\mathcal{D})} \\Bigg[ \\Bigg( r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a \\underbrace{Q(s_{t+1}, a; \\theta^{-}_{i})}_{Target-Network} - \\underbrace{Q(s_t, a_t;\\theta_i)}_{Q-Network} \\Big)^2 \\Bigg]\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And thats it! We can use this update rule inside the Q-Learning algorithm to train a Deep Q-Network with SGD as we do in supervised learning. The corresponding **Deep Q-Learning algorithm** is given in the next part."

This way you can verify and debug your implementation much faster (in minutes vs hours...).

    "\n",
    "The original DQN agent included a CNN as shown in the theory part of this notebook. For our task however, a simple MLP with only one hidden layer should be enough. Starting that simple will help you to get other implementation details right. Later on you can easily scale up and switch the MLP for a more powerfull network.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the architecture will be easy, the DQN algorithm requires us to keep basically two separate networks, namely, a main **Q-Network** and a second **Target-Network**. In addition, Tensorflow requires us to keep a reference to every node we want to calculate with the `sess.run` command. For those reasons we will build a *generic* and reusable `DQNetwork` class and bind all graph nodes to the object. Later we can then simply use the instance objects to reference specifc nodes in a clean and readable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement the `DQNetwork` class below in two steps. The first part denoted as *basic Deep Q-Network*, includes the actual network. The second part denote as *Q-Learning Calculations*, includes all the additional calculations to train the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1 - Basic Deep Q-Network\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is identical for the main Q- and the Target-Network. **It includes all trainable variables of the graph!** The model should be a fully connected feedforward network with one hidden layer of size $64$ and **ReLU** activations. For the CartPole task, the resulting MLP will consequently be later of size `num_inputs=4, num_hidden=64, num_outputs=2`. For the generic `DQNetwork` class however, let the user specify those values as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now create a `self.best_action` node which should take the output layer (or q-values) and **return the indice** of the maximum action value. You can use `tf.argmax` for that. You can query this node in the e-greedy action selection later.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create another node, `self.max_q` which does the same thing but **returns the value** of the maximum action value. You can use `tf.reduce_max` for that. You will need this node for the calculation of the TD-target later.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, everything should have been very straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2 - Q-Learning Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is different for the Q- and the Target-Network. **It includes all the necessary calculations for training the network.** The code skeleton below shows how to constrain the graph creation with two simple if statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the **Target Stream**. This part will later calculate the **TD-Target** (or $y_i$) with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "y_i = r_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a \\underbrace{Q(s_{t+1}, a; \\theta^{-}_{i})}_{Target-Network}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we will train with mini-batches sampled from the replay buffer. For that reason, the `reward` values will be provided by mini-batches. This means we have to feed them externally, so let's create a **placeholder node** for those. Next, gamma will be **a constant** so let's create one in tensorflow and let the user specify it as a parameter at creation time of the network. Next, $s_{t+1}$ are the `next_states` from the buffer. This is not important here but you have to feed them correctly later! To get the maximum action value, use the `self.max_q` node that you have created earlier. Finally, there is a small detail we have not talked about yet. **In the rare case that the next state is a final state, i.e the game is over, only the reward should be taken into account.** To realize this here is a little *trick*: create another placeholder for the boolean `done` values from the mini-batch. Then, multiply the right-hand side of the equation with `tf.abs(self.done - 1)`. For clarity call the final node which implements the equation above `self.td_target`! \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that this is a *lot* of text but basically 4 lines of code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the **Q Stream**. This part will calculate the full **TD-Error** and optimize the mean squared error on the mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray} \n",
    "L_i(\\theta_{i}) = \\mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \\sim U(\\mathcal{D})} \\Bigg[ \\Bigg( y_i - \\underbrace{Q(s_t, a_t;\\theta_i)}_{Q-Network} \\Big)^2 \\Bigg]\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now first, create a placeholder for the **td-target** ($y_i$). These values have been calculated by the Target-Network and we must feed them again to the main Q-Network. Yes, its really two **separate** networks even though they share some code here. Next we need the value of $Q(s_t, a_t;\\theta_i)$. We can query **all action values** by feeding the mini-batch of `states` ($s_t$) from the buffer to the network (first part of the network). The *problem* is that **we only want to select the action value of the action that was actually taken**. Luckily we have this information as part of the mini-batch. We can feed it with an additional placeholder, let's call it `self.actions`. The idea is now to mask the output of the network with a one-hot encoded representation of the action indices from the placeholder. To do this use `tf.one_hot` and call the resulting node `self.actions_onehot` or similar. Finally multiply the one_hot vector with the output of the network and call `tf.reduce_sum` on the result to obtain a clean list of the action values we want. The resulting node, let's call it `self.Q` holds the values of $Q(s_t, a_t;\\theta_i)$ for the complete mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you feel uncomfortable with this *trick* create a toy example in a separate cell in order to understand whats going on here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, now the rest should be straightforward again. Square the difference of `td_target` and `Q` to obtain the **TD-error** and use `tf.reduce_mean` on that to obtain the expected **loss** of the mini-batch. This corresponds to $\\mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s') \\sim U(\\mathcal{D})}$ in the formula. Create an optimizer node such as the AdamOptimizer and again, let the user specifiy the learnin rate as a parameter at creation time of the network. Finally minimize the loss and call this final node something like `self.updateModel` or `self.train`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that this is again a *lot* of text but *only* something like ~8 lines of code!"

    "1. Sample a mini-batch of experience from the replay buffer. In order to feed everything to the DQNetworks, the mixed batch must be reshaped into separate **list** batches (`[]`!) of `observations, actions, rewards, next_observations` and `done`. Make sure this true before creating corresponding feed_dicts! Depending on your replay buffer implementation you way find it handy to use `zip` again and apply the `list` operator with the `map` function, e.g. `map(list, zip(*batch))`. See the cell below for an UnZip demo.\n",
    "2. Prepare an appropriate `feed_dict` and get the `td_target` values by running the Target-Network.\n",

    "Below you can see the **Deep Q-Learning** pseudo code from the original paper. This will help you to get at least the main parts of the algorithm right and should serve as a rough blue print of when to do what inside the loop. In practice, there are many more subtle details which are not mentioned explicitly. For that reason we provide you an additional checklist below the algorithm so you don't miss anything important. **As in the last notebook we strongly recommend to start simple and work through the steps one by one!** In addition, the checklist provides some sane default ranges for the hyperparameters to get you started. Try different settings and make it work :) **If you have problems, better start with *huge* values and reduce them step by step as needed!**\n",

    "## Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you have implemented a basic DQN agent. For simplicity we have left out some important details which are crucial in order to play video games. If you are eager to do this anyway here are the missing parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, switch the simple MLP with the following architecture from the paper. Note that there are no pooling layers in this CNN!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./RL_pics/DQN_architecture.png\" alt=\"DQN\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observability and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not talked about observability so far. Formally, Atari video games are Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes or POMDPs. This means that the game screen is not a sufficient observation to fully describe the underlying state and that the Markov Assumption does not hold. A simple example to makes this clear. Think about the game Pong. Given only one frame, the agent has no way of telling if the ball is currently moving from left to right or from right to left. For that reason the authors used the last 4 frames of the game as observation. This turns the POMDP into an MDP again. Furthermore they applied some more preprocessing steps to the game screens such as turning them into gray scale, rescaling, and taking the max out of two subsequent frames. Please see [the methods section of the DQN paper](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning/) for more details on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint: In order to implement this you have to keep some sort of frame buffer of the last 4 frames etc.!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Details\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to play faster, the authors trained the network only every $K=4$ time step. In between, the last taken action was repeated. This allows to play more games, e.g. gather more experience in less time since stepping the emulator forward is computationally *cheaper* than training the network. Again see the paper for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the authors clipped the reward to the range $R \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. Remember to remove this constraint during testing again to get the *real high score*\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to improve training stability was to clip the gradients (or better the squared L2 loss) to the range -1,1. In other words, only apply L2 if the error is inside this range and take a linear loss outside. This corresponds to a Huber Loss. Here you can find a TensorFlow implementations of that from the [OpenAI baseline agents](https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/24fe3d6576dd8f4cdd5f017805be689d6fa6be8c/baselines/common/tf_util.py#L39). Please read the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss) to see what the function is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original DQN implementation used a slightly modified version of RMSProp as its optimizer. You dont have to implement this. It is perfectly fine to stay with Adam for instance. However, be aware that the learning rate is a really crucial parameter in this context. If at least for any, this is definetly the first (and probably the most important) hyperparameter for which you want to test different settings!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyper Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "See the paper for a list of good default parameters. Due to the lengthy training times you may want to reduce the total amount of time steps the agent will be trained. You also may adjust the exploration accordingly. However, be aware that exploration time is very important. You may want to benchmark a very short training first and then do some rough calculations of how long it will take to train the agent for some $x$ time steps etc. Then plan some experiments. "
