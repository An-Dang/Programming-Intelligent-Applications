This is commonly referred to as one-hot encoding of the labels (only a single position in the label-vector is 1, all other positions are 0). Since our labels are fed as integers, we need to convert them to a one-hot encoding to represent a valid probability distribution before we can use them in the cross-entropy calculation.
